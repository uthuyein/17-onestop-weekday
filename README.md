ArrayList	                    
  Fast random access O(1) but slow insert/delete in the middle (O(n)).Mostly read operations.
  
LinkedList	                    
  Fast insert/delete O(1) but slow random access (O(n)) frequent modifications.
  
HashSet	                      
  Best when uniqueness is required and order doesn't matter.Unordered unique elements, fast operations.
  
TreeSet	                     
  Best when sorting is required.Sorted unique elements.
  
PriorityQueue	                
  Best for priority-based processing.Elements are retrieved in natural ordering (smallest first).
  
ArrayDeque	                    
  Best for LIFO (Stack) and FIFO (Queue).Faster than Stack and LinkedList for push/pop operations.
  
HashMap	                      
  Fast key-value lookups O(1) average.Best for key-value storage when ordering is not needed.
  
TreeMap	                      
  Sorted key-value pairs (O(log n) operations).Best when sorted order is required.
